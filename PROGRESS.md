                                                       ↓
                                              Upload to ArDrive (Turbo)
                                                       ↓
                                              Record in Database
                                              (uploads + usage tables)
                                                       ↓
                                              Send Confirmation Email
                                              (with usage summary & links)
```

## 📈 Progress Timeline

- **Week 1** (Oct 15): Code audit, planning, cleanup
- **Week 2** (Oct 15-17): Foundation (config, database, services)
- **Week 3** (Oct 17-20): IMAP implementation, job queue, email notifications
- **Status**: All core features complete, ready for server deployment

## 🎉 Summary

**Total Implementation Time**: ~3 weeks (from inherited broken code to production-ready)

**Lines of Code**: ~2,500 lines of new TypeScript code
