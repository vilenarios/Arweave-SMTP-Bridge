# Code Audit Report: Arweave SMTP Bridge
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Junior developer handoff - Production readiness assessment

---

## Executive Summary

This codebase is **NOT production-ready** and requires significant refactoring before it can be turned into a viable business. The project shows signs of experimentation with multiple abandoned approaches, critical security vulnerabilities, and incomplete implementation of core features.

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH** - Do not deploy to production

---

## Critical Bugs (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. **Multiple Conflicting Entry Points** üî¥ BLOCKER
- `index.ts` - Currently modified to just download emails (no Arweave upload)
- `index_og.ts` - Calls `handleIncomingEmails()` properly
- `index_cron.ts` - Cron-based approach (downloads but no upload)
- `index_imapflow.ts` - Identical copy of index_cron.ts

**Impact**: Unclear which file should be the entry point. Current `package.json` points to `index.ts` which is broken.

**Fix**: Consolidate to single entry point, delete experimental files.

---

### 2. **GraphQL Query Syntax Errors** üî¥ BLOCKER
**File**: `src/services/user-manager.ts:156, 202`

```typescript
// BROKEN - Misplaced parenthesis
transactions(
  owners:[${owner}])  // <-- Wrong!
  tags: [
```

**Impact**: Drive/folder indexing will always fail, making ArDrive uploads impossible.

**Fix**: Move closing parenthesis after tags array.

---

### 3. **User Wallet System is Non-Functional** üî¥ CRITICAL
**File**: `src/services/user-manager.ts:54`

```typescript
// Creates user wallets but doesn't use them
const mainJWK = JSON.parse(readFileSync(process.env.ARWEAVE_JWK_PATH || './wallet.json', 'utf-8'));
const jwkWallet = new JWKWallet(mainJWK); // Always uses main wallet!
```

**Impact**: All uploads use the same main wallet. Per-user wallets are created but never used. Entire user management system is non-functional.

**Fix**: Either use user wallets OR remove user wallet creation entirely.

---

### 4. **Missing Authentication in Main Entry Point** üî¥ CRITICAL
**File**: `index.ts` (current modified version)

The modified `index.ts` doesn't check `isAllowedEmail()`, meaning it would process emails from anyone.

**Fix**: Add authentication check or use `index_og.ts` as entry point.

---

### 5. **All Tests are Disabled** üü° HIGH
**File**: `src/services/__tests__/email-upload.test.ts:125`

```typescript
describe.skip('Email Upload Service', () => {
```

**Impact**: No automated testing. Unknown if any functionality actually works.

**Fix**: Re-enable and update tests to match current implementation.

---

### 6. **Hardcoded Encryption Secret** üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY
**File**: `src/services/user-manager.ts:8`

```typescript
const SYSTEM_SECRET = process.env.FORWARD_ENCRYPTION_SECRET || 'change-me';
```

**Impact**: If not set, all user wallets are encrypted with 'change-me'. Trivial to decrypt.

**Fix**: Fail on startup if not set. Never use defaults for secrets.

---

### 7. **Type Error in Utils** üü° MEDIUM
**File**: `src/services/utils.ts:47`

```typescript
export function sleep(ms) { // <-- No type annotation
```

**Fix**: Add `ms: number` type annotation.

---

### 8. **No Cleanup of Processing Set** üü° MEDIUM
**File**: `src/services/email-upload.ts:15`

```typescript
const processingUids = new Set<number>();
```

UIDs are added but never removed from the set, causing memory leak over time.

**Fix**: Remove from set after processing completes.

---

## Architectural Issues

### 1. **No Separation of Concerns**
`email-upload.ts` (375 lines) does everything:
- IMAP connection
- Email parsing
- Authentication
- Routing (ArDrive vs Turbo)
- File upload
- Email sending

**Recommendation**: Split into:
- `IMAPService` - Connection management
- `EmailParser` - Email parsing
- `UploadRouter` - Route to appropriate handler
- `UploadHandler` - Abstract interface with implementations

---

### 2. **Duplicate Code**
- `index_cron.ts` and `index_imapflow.ts` are 100% identical
- Email parsing logic duplicated across multiple files
- Attachment handling duplicated

**Recommendation**: Extract shared logic into reusable services.

---

### 3. **JSON File as Database**
`user-store/users.json` - Not scalable, no ACID guarantees, no concurrent access control.

**Recommendation**: Use SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL for production.

---

### 4. **No Configuration Validation**
Environment variables are read with `|| ''` fallbacks everywhere, causing silent failures.

**Recommendation**: Use a config validation library (Zod, Joi) and fail fast on startup.

---

### 5. **Synchronous Upload Processing**
Emails with large attachments block the entire system. No queue, no concurrency control.

**Recommendation**: Implement job queue (BullMQ, pg-boss).

---

### 6. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
Some functions throw, some return, some log and continue silently.

**Recommendation**: Standardize error handling strategy.

---

### 7. **No Logging Framework**
Just `console.log` everywhere. No log levels, no structured logging, no retention.

**Recommendation**: Use pino or winston with structured JSON logs.

---

## Security Vulnerabilities

### üî¥ CRITICAL

1. **Wallet File in Repository**
   - `wallet.json` appears in glob results
   - Should be in `.gitignore`
   - **Risk**: Private keys exposed if pushed to public repo

2. **Weak User Wallet Encryption**
   - AES-256-CTR without authentication (no HMAC)
   - Vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks
   - **Fix**: Use AES-GCM or encrypt-then-MAC

3. **GraphQL Injection**
   - User-manager.ts constructs GraphQL queries with string interpolation
   - `owners:[${owner}]` - No escaping
   - **Fix**: Use parameterized queries or proper GraphQL client

### üü° HIGH

4. **No Input Validation**
   - Email content, filenames, subjects not validated
   - Could lead to path traversal, XSS in emails, etc.

5. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Allowlisted user could spam unlimited uploads
   - **Fix**: Implement per-user rate limits

6. **Temporary Files in Predictable Locations**
   - `./tmp/${Date.now()}-${filename}`
   - Timing attacks possible
   - **Fix**: Use crypto.randomBytes for temp filenames

7. **Missing HTTPS/TLS Configuration**
   - SMTP transport config doesn't explicitly require TLS
   - **Fix**: Add `secure: true` and `requireTLS: true`

### üü¢ MEDIUM

8. **Environment Variables in Plaintext**
   - Consider using a secrets manager for production

9. **No CSRF Protection** (if API added later)

10. **No Content Security Policy** (if web dashboard added)

## What Actually Works

‚úÖ **Basic email receiving** - IMAP connection works
‚úÖ **Email parsing** - mailparser integration functional
‚úÖ **Turbo SDK uploads** - When called properly, uploads work
‚úÖ **Arweave.js uploads** - Alternative SDK works
‚úÖ **QR code generation** - Email confirmations include QR codes
‚úÖ **Subject line filtering** - Prevents accidental uploads
‚úÖ **Encryption utilities** - crypto.ts functions work (though weak)
‚úÖ **ArDrive integration** - ardrive-core-js properly configured

---

## What Doesn't Work

‚ùå **Entry point** - index.ts is broken
‚ùå **User wallets** - Created but never used

‚ùå **Testing** - All tests skipped
‚ùå **Authentication in index.ts** - Missing allowlist check
‚ùå **Error recovery** - No retry logic in many places
‚ùå **File cleanup** - Scattered and incomplete

## Estimated Effort to Production

**Current State**: ~30% complete (core upload logic exists)
**Estimated Work Remaining**: 6-8 weeks full-time development
**Risk Level**: High - requires architectural changes

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT** attempt to patch this codebase for production use. The issues run too deep.

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH**:
1. Extract the working upload logic (arweave-upload.ts, ardrive-upload.ts)
2. Rebuild the application with proper architecture
3. Use this as a reference implementation, not the foundation

The junior dev did good exploratory work, but this needs a ground-up rebuild with:
- Proper separation of concerns
- Database instead of JSON files
- Job queue for async processing
- Comprehensive testing
- Security-first design
- Business features from day 1

---

## Questions for Product/Business

Before refactoring, we need clarity on:

1. **Business Model**: Per-upload fee? Subscription? Freemium?
2. **Target Users**: Individuals? Enterprises? Both?
3. **Scale**: Expected users/uploads per month?
4. **Features**: Which upload method is primary? (Turbo vs ArDrive vs both)
5. **Infrastructure**: Cloud provider preference? Budget?
6. **Timeline**: Hard launch date? MVP features?
