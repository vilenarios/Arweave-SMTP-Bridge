# ForwARd - Email to Permanent Storage

ForwARd is an email-to-ArDrive bridge that automatically uploads email attachments to permanent, encrypted storage on Arweave. Simply send an email with attachments to your configured inbox, and they'll be securely stored forever.

**Business Model**: Pay-per-use with free tier
- 10 free emails per month
- $0.10 per email after free tier
- Private ArDrive storage with encryption

## Features

- üìß **Email-based uploads** - Send attachments via email, get permanent storage
- üîí **Private encrypted storage** - Each user gets a private ArDrive with AES-256-GCM encryption
- üí∞ **Free tier** - 10 uploads per month free, pay-per-use after
- üîÑ **Reliable processing** - Job queue with automatic retries (3 attempts)
- üìä **Usage tracking** - Know exactly how many free emails you have left
- üöÄ **Fast uploads** - Uses ArDrive Turbo for bundled transactions
- ‚úâÔ∏è **Confirmation emails** - Get ArDrive links and transaction details
- üõ°Ô∏è **Email allowlist** - Restrict access to specific users or domains
- üëõ **Flexible wallet modes** - Single master wallet or per-user isolated wallets with credit sharing

## Requirements

- **Bun runtime** (1.0+)
- **Redis** (for job queue)
- **Gmail account** with App Password enabled
- **Arweave wallet** with AR balance (for storage costs)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd arweave-smtp-bridge

```

### 2. Install Redis

**Using Docker (recommended):**
```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
```

**Using system package manager:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server

# macOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Verify Redis is running
redis-cli ping  # Should return "PONG"
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

nano .env
```

**Required environment variables:**

```bash
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
EMAIL_HOST=imap.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=993
EMAIL_TLS=true

# Arweave Wallet (path to JWK file)
ARWEAVE_JWK_PATH=./wallet.json

# Wallet Mode
# - 'single': Use master wallet for all uploads (simpler, default)
# - 'multi': Create per-user wallets with Turbo credit sharing (isolated)
WALLET_MODE=single

# Database (SQLite - auto-created)
DATABASE_URL=./data/forward.db

# Redis (for job queue)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Security - Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64-char-hex-string>
API_KEY_SECRET=<32+-char-random-string>

# Email Allowlist (comma-separated)
# Examples:
#   Single user: user@example.com
#   Multiple users: user1@example.com,user2@example.com
#   Whole domain: *@example.com
FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS=your-email@gmail.com

```

## How to Use

### Send an Email

1. Send an email **to** the address configured in `EMAIL_USER`
2. Attach one or more files
3. The sender email must be in your `FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS` list

### What Happens Next

1. **IMAP service** detects the new email (polls every 30 seconds)
2. **Job queue** processes the email asynchronously
3. **Authorization check** validates sender is in allowlist
4. **Usage check** verifies you haven't exceeded free tier
5. **Upload to ArDrive** creates/uses your private encrypted drive
6. **Database records** the upload and tracks usage
7. **Confirmation email** sent with:
   - ArDrive file links
   - Transaction details
   - Usage summary (e.g., "You've used 5/10 free emails this month")

## Wallet Modes

ForwARd supports two wallet modes via the `WALLET_MODE` environment variable:

### Single Wallet Mode (Default)
```bash
WALLET_MODE=single
```
- All uploads use the master wallet (specified in `ARWEAVE_JWK_PATH`)
- Simpler setup, no per-user wallet management
- All users share the same wallet for storage costs
- **Recommended for**: Personal use or small teams with centralized billing

### Multi-Wallet Mode
```bash
WALLET_MODE=multi
```
- Each user gets their own custodied Arweave wallet
- Wallets auto-generated on first upload (12-word seed phrase stored encrypted)
- Uses Turbo credit sharing with 30-day expiration for just-in-time funding
- Perfect isolation between users
- Wallet address shown in welcome email
- **Recommended for**: Production deployments with multiple independent users

**Note**: When switching modes, existing users will continue working. New users will use the new mode's wallet strategy.

## Email Allowlist

The `FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS` variable controls who can use your ForwARd instance.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Single user
FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS=alice@example.com

# Multiple users
FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS=alice@example.com,bob@example.com

# Everyone at a domain
FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS=*@example.com

# Mix of specific users and domain
FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS=alice@gmail.com,*@mycompany.com
```

## Billing & Usage

### Free Tier
- **10 emails per month** are free
- Resets on the 1st of each month
- Usage tracked per sender email address

### Paid Usage
- **$0.10 per email** after free tier
- Cost calculated automatically
- Track usage in confirmation emails

### View Usage

**Check database:**
```bash
bunx drizzle-kit studio
# Opens web UI at http://localhost:4983
# View 'usage' and 'uploads' tables
```

**In confirmation emails:**
```
You've used 12/10 free emails this month
Cost for this upload: $0.20
Total cost this month: $0.20
```

## Development

### Run Tests

```bash
bun test
```

### View Database

### Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun with TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Queue**: BullMQ + Redis
- **Storage**: ArDrive Core JS v3 with Turbo
- **Email**: ImapFlow (IMAP) + Nodemailer (SMTP)
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for drive passwords
- **Validation**: Zod for configuration

## Troubleshooting

### "Configuration validation failed"
- Check all required variables are in `.env`
- Run `bun run src/config/env.ts` to see specific errors

### "IMAP connection failed"
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct
- Check `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- Ensure 2-step verification is enabled in Google

### "Redis connection failed"
- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Check `REDIS_URL` in `.env`

### "Email not authorized"
- Add sender email to `FORWARD_ALLOWED_EMAILS`
- Use exact email or wildcard: `*@example.com`

### "ArDrive upload failed"
- Check wallet has sufficient AR balance
- Verify `ARWEAVE_JWK_PATH` points to valid JWK file
- Check console logs for detailed error

### Email not being processed
- Wait up to 30 seconds (polling interval)
- Check `processedEmails` table in database
- View Redis queue: `redis-cli LLEN bull:email-processor:waiting`
- Check logs for errors

## Database Schema

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed schema documentation.

**Tables:**
- `users` - User accounts with plan info and optional wallet data
